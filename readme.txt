This is a web-scraping project that tries to get phone numbers from https://telefonbuch-suche.com/ .
This is a just for fun project, to help me get better at web-scraping.

Dependencies
------------
* requests
* bs4 (beautifulsoup4)
* time.time()
* sqlite3

Goal
----
Goal is to scrape all names completely with address and phone number (estimate = 60.000.000 names).

ToDoÂ´s
------
- [X] get basic scraping of names
- [X] create readme.txt
- [ ] Error-handling (raspberry ran into first error after ~60.000 names)
- [ ] improve performance (use multi-threading)
- [X] write result into a db instead "city_name".csv files
- [ ] make code more object-oriented
- [ ] implement stop-resume functionality
